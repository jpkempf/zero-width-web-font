Using Adobe Blank for better inline-block grids
===================

Inline-block grids without the need for any weird comment hacks are possible if you use Adobe Blank, a special-purpose font that covers all Unicode code points and renders them using a non-spacing and non-marking glyph.

All credit should go to these guys:

* [@ken_lunde](http://twitter.com/ken_lunde) from Adobe for creating the font
* [@ScottKellum](http://www.twitter.com/ScottKellum) for making me aware of its uses

So what now?
